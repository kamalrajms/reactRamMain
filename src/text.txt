## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

## structure

## import export
## styleing
    global files
    external files
    module.css files
    inline css
    object way styleing

## props

    Props stands for properties.
    They are inputs to React components, like arguments to a function.
    Props let you pass data from a parent component â†’ child component.
    They are read-only (child cannot modify props directly).
    
        Props method
        destructuring props

## useState 

    useState is a react hook , the data that changes over time 
    (eg.. user input, API response)

    syntex:
        const[statevariable,setStateVariable]=useState(initial value)

        initial value---starting value
        statevariable----current value
        setStateVariable--- to update current value


## conditional rendering

        conditional rendering means showing or hiding parts 
        of UI based on some conditions.

        ## ternary operator
        ## logical operator

## list rendering

        rendering multiple items dynamically useing .map(),reduce()....

        
## useEffect()

    useEffectis a react hook, that lets you perform side effect 
    in functional components.
    side effect are tasks that happends outside the normal react rendering process 

        fetching data from API
        Updating the browser DOM manually

    useEffect(()=>{

        //code
        
    },[dependencies 1,dependencies 2....])

## useref()

    useref is react hook that gives you a box(.current) you can store anydata in---
    like num,string,object,array,function....

    that value persists between rendering

    Updating it does't cause your component to re-rendering
